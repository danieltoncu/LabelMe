<p>In this paper we describe the work carried out in order to implement a system which allows users to define and discover semantic categories for short texts. A label (category) can be defined either aș a set of lexical features or a set of texts exemplifying that label. Texts can also be clustered around included lexical elements, which may help discover and define new labels. The user can use the provided UI to manage the semantic labels and texts processed by the system. The main difficulties faced in developing the system were mainly regarding defining a semantic label, processing the text and associating a text with accurate labels.</p>

<p>Associating semantic labels to texts is one of the most relevant Lantural Language Processing tasks, aș it is one of the first steps required în order to manage the large (and increasing) quantities of text available. For the average user, the ability to sort, filter and group e-mails, news, forum posts, can have significant benefits în time saved accessing data and in minimising the risk of missing important information. Describing the semantic context of a text has been one of the main priorities of NLP researchers [1], [2]., solutions proposed offering significant insights into how humans understand the meaning of a text but failing to offer a universal method of transforming that meaning into a universally accepted computer-friendly representation. Many proposed solutions [3] [4] [5] offer pragmatic approaches to the problem, either by simplifying the requirements to matching text to semantic representations, finding particular data (like in Question Answering systems) or assigning semantic labels to texts.
Section 2 of this paper briefly describes the way semantic labels are managed in our system, section 3 showing how those labels are automatically associated to short texts. Section 4 indicates the consideration made while designing an UI and shows how the implemented functionalities can be used in the current UI. Section 5 is a brief overview of the current state of the system and the planned further development efforts.</p>
